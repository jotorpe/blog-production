					<p>
					I started in the world of research in the University of Granada in an unexpected way.
					When I was finishing my civil engineering degree, I was looking for another career to 
					pursue because I did not feel comfortable in that field. It was then that I discovered 
					the Ultrasonics Lab at the University of Granada, where they applied the knowledge learned to biomechanics. 
					That really caught my attention and enthusiasm quickly. This opportunity allowed me to become a co-founder 
					of the spin-off <a href="https://www.innitius.com/">Innitius</a>. At the same time, a colleague specialized in law and patents proposed me to start a 
					small project to help bring technology-based ideas to fruition, doing feasibility studies and protection of ideas. 
					However, it was a task that required more time from us.

					Since then, I have been looking for opportunities to diversify my training and see with different eyes a
					future that I had not even thought of. I am much more interested in applied research, which is not merely 
					an explanation of fundamentals, which of course is also essential. Here my contact with physicians during 
					certain projects to which I have been assigned has played a very important role. One realizes that multidisciplinarity
					is not only the combination of two a priori very different fields, but also the understanding of the point of view and 
					way of working of others. I note that the system in Spain for obtaining a stable academic or scientific position is 
					bordering on unhealthy competition. Therefore, I hope that my future lies in professional non-destructive evaluation,
					as I would like to work on truly revolutionary techniques that will help both industry and medicine. I believe that 
					the course can give me that point of view outside the classical academic world.

					<p>
					After several years working in the world of research I have discovered that writing not only helps to make ideas clear 
					and easy to consult, but it has also presented itself to me as an interesting activity, almost a meditation in which 
					to place the knowledge acquired.
					</p>

					<p>
					In this post I try to give a professional face, although it includes a lot of my tastes and hobbies. 
					So some sections are oriented to the working world, and others are for the pleasure of showing my 
					contributions to the world. Art comes to me as a very satisfying activity.
